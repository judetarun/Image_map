        Artificial turf is a surface made of synthetic fibers designed to mimic the look and feel of natural grass.
        Initially gaining prominence in the 1960s with the introduction of AstroTurf, it has since evolved significantly.
        Modern artificial turf is used in various settings, including sports arenas, residential lawns, and commercial landscapes.â€‹
